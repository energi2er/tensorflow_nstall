Thank you.

That helped in my case. CUDA 11.8 with cuDNN 8.9.5 is working on driver 535, ubuntu 22.04 kernel 6.32

sudo sh cuda_12.2.0_535.54.03_linux.run 
!install it without driver
!add drectory of cuda to PATH -post-installation-actions
!https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html#post-installation-actions
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.2/lib64\
                         ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}

export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.2/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}

Driver:   Not Selected
Toolkit:  Installed in /usr/local/cuda-12.2/

Please make sure that
 -   PATH includes /usr/local/cuda-12.2/bin
 -   LD_LIBRARY_PATH includes /usr/local/cuda-12.2/lib64, or, add /usr/local/cuda-12.2/lib64 to /etc/ld.so.conf and run ldconfig as root

To uninstall the CUDA Toolkit, run cuda-uninstaller in /usr/local/cuda-12.2/bin
***WARNING: Incomplete installation! This installation did not install the CUDA Driver. A driver of version at least 535.00 is required for CUDA 12.2 functionality to work.
To install the driver using this installer, run the following command, replacing <CudaInstaller> with the name of this run file:
    sudo <CudaInstaller>.run --silent --driver

Logfile is /var/log/cuda-installer.log



!!!!!if you have problem of not saving PATH after closing shell or reboot use this
echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.2/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.2/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}' >> ~/.bashrc

!POWER9 Setup
systemctl status nvidia-persistenced
sudo systemctl enable nvidia-persistenced


!Disabling Nouveau
!Create a file at /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nouveau.conf with the following contents:

sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nouveau.conf

blacklist nouveau
options nouveau modeset=0
sudo update-initramfs -u
