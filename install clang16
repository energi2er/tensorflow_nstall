To install Clang 16 on Ubuntu, you can follow these steps:

1. **Add LLVM Repository**: LLVM provides pre-built packages for Ubuntu. You can add the LLVM repository to your system by running the following commands:

    ```bash
    wget https://apt.llvm.org/llvm.sh
    chmod +x llvm.sh
    sudo ./llvm.sh 16
    ```

    This script automatically detects your Ubuntu version and adds the appropriate LLVM repository for Clang 16.

2. **Update Package List**: After adding the LLVM repository, update the package list:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```

3. **Install Clang 16**: Once the package list is updated, you can install Clang 16:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install clang-16
    ```

    This command will install Clang 16 and its dependencies.

4. **Verify Installation**: After installation, you can verify that Clang 16 is installed correctly by checking the version:

    ```bash
    clang-16 --version
    ```

    This command should output the version number of the installed Clang compiler.

5. **Optional: Set Clang Version as Default**: If you want to use Clang 16 as the default compiler on your system, you can use the `update-alternatives` command to configure the default version. For example:

    ```bash
    sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clang clang /usr/bin/clang-16 100
    sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clang++ clang++ /usr/bin/clang++-16 100
    ```

    This command sets the priority of Clang 16 to 100, ensuring that it becomes the default version if you have multiple versions installed.

By following these steps, you should have Clang 16 installed on your Ubuntu system. You can now use it for compiling your C and C++ programs.
